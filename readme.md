# LinkedIn Scraper using Selenium, Node, and React

This project aims to create a LinkedIn scraper using Selenium, Node, and React. The scraper retrieves data from LinkedIn profiles and returns it in JSON format.

## Installation

To run the LinkedIn scraper, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install the Mozilla Firefox browser.
2. Set up Selenium in your local environment.
3. Create a profile in Mozilla and log in with your LinkedIn profile. Delete all other profiles.
4. Give the path of that profile in the backend code (`server.js`).
5. Install all dependencies in the frontend and backend directories.
6. Start the backend server and frontend app.
7. Visit the running port to fetch data.

## Usage

The process works by entering a query on the frontend, which is then sent to the backend API. The Selenium driver is started, and it visits the browser to fetch all the data and returns it in JSON format.

## Future Work

In the future, the goal is to make the scraper fully functional with the integration of backend, frontend, and all kinds of filters. Additionally, proper documentation will be created on how to use it and how it is implemented, with a proper template.
